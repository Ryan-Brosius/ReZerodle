# ReZero.dle App

This is a website me and my friend Ethan worked on inspired by the loldle website you can find [here](https://loldle.net/classic).<br>
It uses Flask to call the python backend, and some javascript to parse that backend. I had a lot of fun trying to figure out how the<br>
loldle website works, and making this website fun and unique it its own way. I hope you enjoy playing the game as much as I did creating it!<br>
